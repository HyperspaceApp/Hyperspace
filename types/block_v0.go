	// A Block is a summary of changes to the state that have occurred since the
	// previous block. Blocks reference the ID of the previous block (their
	// "parent"), creating the linked-list commonly known as the blockchain. Their
	// primary function is to bundle together transactions on the network. Blocks
	// are created by "miners," who collect transactions from other nodes, and
	// then try to pick a Nonce that results in a block whose BlockID is below a
	// given Target.
