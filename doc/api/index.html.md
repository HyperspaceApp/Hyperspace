# Introduction

## Welcome to the Sia Storage Platform API!
> Example GET curl call 

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" "localhost:9980/wallet/transactions?startheight=1&endheight=250"
```

> Example POST curl call

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" --data "amount=123&destination=abcd" "localhost:9980/wallet/siacoins"
```

Sia uses semantic versioning and is backwards compatible to version v1.0.0.

API calls return either JSON or no content. Success is indicated by 2xx HTTP status codes, while errors are indicated by 4xx and 5xx HTTP status codes. If an endpoint does not specify its expected status code refer to [standard responses](#Standard-Responses).

There may be functional API calls which are not documented. These are not guaranteed to be supported beyond the current release, and should not be used in production.

**Notes:**

- Requests must set their User-Agent string to contain the substring "Sia-Agent".
- By default, siad listens on "localhost:9980". This can be changed using the `--api-addr` flag when running siad.
- **Do not bind or expose the API to a non-loopback address unless you are aware of the possible dangers.**

## Documentation Standards

The following details the documentation standards for the API endpoints.
 - Endpoints should follow the structure of:
    - Parameters
    - Response
 - Each endpoint should have a corresponding curl example
 - All non-standard responses should have a JSON Response example
  with units
 - There should be detailed descriptions of all JSON response fields
 - There should be detailed descriptions of all query string parameters
 - Query String Parameters should be separated into **REQUIRED** and **OPTIONAL** sections
 - Detailed descriptions should be structured as "**field** | units"

Contributors should follow these standards when submitting updates to the API documentation.  If you find API endpoints that do not adhere to these documentation standards please let the Sia team know by submitting an issue [here](https://gitlab.com/NebulousLabs/Sia/issues)

# Standard Responses

## Success
The standard response indicating the request was successfully processed is HTTP status code `204 No Content`. If the request was successfully processed and the server responded with JSON the HTTP status code is `200 OK`. Specific endpoints may specify other 2xx status codes on success.

## Error

```go
{
    "message": String

    // There may be additional fields depending on the specific error.
}
```

The standard error response indicating the request failed for any reason, is a 4xx or 5xx HTTP status code with an error JSON object describing the error.

# Authentication

API authentication is enabled by default, using a password stored in a flat file. The location of this file is:

 - Linux:   `$HOME/.sia/apipassword`
 - MacOS:   `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Sia/apipassword`
 - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Sia\apipassword`


Note that the file contains a trailing newline, which must be trimmed before
use.

Authentication is HTTP Basic Authentication as described in [RFC 2617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617), however, the username is the empty string. The flag does not enforce authentication on all API endpoints. Only endpoints that expose sensitive information or modify state require authentication.

For example, if the API password is "foobar" the request header should include

`Authorization: Basic OmZvb2Jhcg==`

Authentication can be disabled by passing the `--authenticate-api=false` flag to siad. You can change the password by modifying the password file, setting the `SIA_API_PASSWORD` environment variable, or passing the `--temp-password` flag to siad.

# Units

Unless otherwise noted, all parameters should be identified in their smallest possible unit. For example, size should always be specified in bytes and Siacoins should always be specified in hastings. JSON values returned by the API will also use the smallest possible unit, unless otherwise noted.

If a number is returned as a string in JSON, it should be treated as an arbitrary-precision number (bignum), and it should be parsed with your language's corresponding bignum library. Currency values are the most common example where this is necessary.

# Consensus

The consensus set manages everything related to consensus and keeps the blockchain in sync with the rest of the network. The consensus set's API endpoint returns information about the state of the blockchain.

## /consensus [GET]

Returns information about the consensus set, such as the current block height.

### JSON Response

**extremefuturethreshold** | seconds
Farthest a block's timestamp can be in the future before the block is rejected outright.  

**futurethreshold** | seconds
How far in the future a block can be without being rejected. A block further into the future will not be accepted immediately, but the daemon will attempt to accept the block as soon as it is valid.  

**genesistimestamp** | unix timestamp
Timestamp of the genesis block.  

**maturitydelay** | number of blocks
Number of children a block must have before it is considered "mature."  

**mediantimestampwindow** | number of blocks

**siafundportion** | fraction
Fraction of each file contract payout given to siafund holders.  

**targetwindow** | number of blocks
Height of the window used to adjust the difficulty.  

**initialcoinbase** | siacoin
Number of coins given to the miner of the first block. Note that elsewhere in the API currency is typically returned in hastings and as a bignum. This is not the case here.  

**minimumcoinbase** | siacoin
Minimum number of coins paid out to the miner of a block (the coinbase decreases with each block). Note that elsewhere in the API currency is typically returned in hastings and as a bignum. This is not the case here.  

**roottarget** | hash
Initial target.  

**rootdepth** | hash
Initial depth.  

**maxtargetadjustmentup** | fraction
Largest allowed ratio between the old difficulty and the new difficulty.  

**maxtargetadjustmentdown** | fraction
Smallest allowed ratio between the old difficulty and the new difficulty.  

**siacoinprecision** | hastings per siacoin
Number of Hastings in one Siacoin.  

## /daemon/stop [GET]

Cleanly shuts down the daemon. This may take a few seconds.

### Response
standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /daemon/version [GET]

Returns the version of the Sia daemon currently running. 

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example
 
```go
{
"version": "1.3.7" // string
}
```
**version** | string
This is the version number that is visible to its peers on the network.

# Gateway

The gateway maintains a peer to peer connection to the network and provides a method for calling RPCs on connected peers. The gateway's API endpoints expose methods for viewing the connected peers, manually connecting to peers, and manually disconnecting from peers. The gateway may connect or disconnect from peers on its own.

## /gateway [GET]

returns information about the gateway, including the list of connected peers.

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example
 
```go
{
    "netaddress":"333.333.333.333:9981",  // string
    "peers":[
        {
            "inbound":    alse,                    // boolean
            "local":      false,                   // boolean
            "netaddress": "222.222.222.222:9981",  // string
            "version":    "1.0.0",                 // string
        },
    ],
    "maxdownloadspeed": 1234,  // bytes per second
    "maxuploadspeed":   1234,  // bytes per second
}
```
**netaddress** | string
netaddress is the network address of the gateway as seen by the rest of the network. The address consists of the external IP address and the port Sia is listening on. It represents a `modules.NetAddress`.  

**peers** | array
peers is an array of peers the gateway is connected to. It represents an array of `modules.Peer`s.  
        
**inbound** | boolean
inbound is true when the peer initiated the connection. This field is exposed as outbound peers are generally trusted more than inbound peers, as inbound peers are easily manipulated by an adversary.  

**local** | boolean
local is true if the peer's IP address belongs to a local address range such as 192.168.x.x or 127.x.x.x  

**netaddress** | string
netaddress is the address of the peer. It represents a `modules.NetAddress`.  
        
**version** | string
version is the version number of the peer.  

**maxdownloadspeed** | bytes per second
Max download speed permitted in bytes per second

**maxuploadspeed** | bytes per second
Max upload speed permitted in bytes per second

## /gateway [POST]

Modify settings that control the gateway's behavior.

### Query String Parameters
#### OPTIONAL
**maxdownloadspeed** | bytes per second
Max download speed permitted, speed provide in bytes per second.  

**maxuploadspeed** | bytes per second
Max upload speed permitted, speed provide in bytes per second.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /gateway/connect/:*netaddress* [POST]

connects the gateway to a peer. The peer is added to the node list if it is not already present. The node list is the list of all nodes the gateway knows about, but is not necessarily connected to.  

### Path Parameters
#### REQUIRED
netaddress is the address of the peer to connect to. It should be a reachable ip address and port number, of the form `IP:port`. IPV6 addresses must be enclosed in square brackets.  

**netaddress** | string
Example IPV4 address: 123.456.789.0:123  
Example IPV6 address: [123::456]:789  

### Response
standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#Standard-Responses).

## /gateway/disconnect/:*netaddress* [POST]

disconnects the gateway from a peer. The peer remains in the node list. Disconnecting from a peer does not prevent the gateway from automatically connecting to the peer in the future.

### Path Parameters
#### REQUIRED
netaddress is the address of the peer to connect to. It should be a reachable ip address and port number, of the form `IP:port`. IPV6 addresses must be enclosed in square brackets.  

**netaddress** | string
Example IPV4 address: 123.456.789.0:123  
Example IPV6 address: [123::456]:789  

### Response
standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

# Host

The host provides storage from local disks to the network. The host negotiates file contracts with remote renters to earn money for storing other users' files. The host's endpoints expose methods for viewing and modifying host settings, announcing to the network, and managing how files are stored on disk.

## /host [GET]

fetches status information about the host.

#### externalsettings  
The settings that get displayed to untrusted nodes querying the host's status.  
  
**acceptingcontracts** | boolean  
Whether or not the host is accepting new contracts.  

**maxdownloadbatchsize** | bytes  
The maximum size of a single download request from a renter. Each download request has multiple round trips of communication that exchange money. Larger batch sizes mean fewer round trips, but more financial risk for the host - the renter can get a free batch when downloading by refusing to provide a signature.  

**maxduration** | blocks  
The maximum duration that a host will allow for a file contract. The host commits to keeping files for the full duration under the threat of facing a large penalty for losing or dropping data before the duration is complete. The storage proof window of an incoming file contract must end before the current height + maxduration.  

**maxrevisebatchsize** | bytes  
The maximum size of a single batch of file contract revisions. The renter can perform DoS attacks on the host by uploading a batch of data then refusing to provide a signature to pay for the data. The host can reduce this exposure by limiting the batch size. Larger batch sizes allow for higher throughput as there is significant communication overhead associated with performing a batch upload.  

**netaddress** | string
The IP address or hostname (including port) that the host should be contacted at.  

**remainingstorage** | bytes  
The amount of unused storage capacity on the host in bytes. It should be noted that the host can lie.  

**sectorsize** | bytes  
The smallest amount of data in bytes that can be uploaded or downloaded when performing calls to the host.  

**totalstorage** | bytes  
The total amount of storage capacity on the host. It should be noted that the host can lie.  

**unlockhash** | hash
The unlock hash is the address at which the host can be paid when forming file contracts.  

**windowsize** | blocks  
The storage proof window is the number of blocks that the host has to get a storage proof onto the blockchain. The window size is the minimum size of window that the host will accept in a file contract.  

**collateral** | hastings / byte / block  
The maximum amount of money that the host will put up as collateral for storage that is contracted by the renter.  

**maxcollateral** | hastings  
The maximum amount of collateral that the host will put into a single file contract.  

**contractprice** | hastings  
The price that a renter has to pay to create a contract with the host. The payment is intended to cover transaction fees for the file contract revision and the storage proof that the host will be submitting to the blockchain.  

**downloadbandwidthprice** | hastings / byte  
The price that a renter has to pay when downloading data from the host.  

**storageprice** | hastings / byte / block  
The price that a renter has to pay to store files with the host.  

**uploadbandwidthprice** | hastings / byte  
The price that a renter has to pay when uploading data to the host.  

**revisionnumber** | int 
The revision number indicates to the renter what iteration of settings the host is currently at. Settings are generally signed. If the renter has multiple conflicting copies of settings from the host, the renter can expect the one with the higher revision number to be more recent.  

**version** | string
The version of external settings being used. This field helps coordinate updates while preserving compatibility with older nodes.  

#### financialmetrics  
The financial status of the host.  
  
**contractcount** | int
Number of open file contracts.  

**contractcompensation** | hastings  
The amount of money that renters have given to the host to pay for file contracts. The host is required to submit a file contract revision and a storage proof for every file contract that gets created, and the renter pays for the miner fees on  these objects.  

**potentialcontractcompensation** | hastings  
The amount of money that renters have given to the host to pay for file contracts which have not been confirmed yet. The potential compensation becomes compensation after the storage proof is submitted.  

**lockedstoragecollateral** | hastings  
The amount of storage collateral which the host has tied up in file contracts. The host has to commit collateral to a file contract even if there is no storage, but the locked collateral will be returned even if the host does not submit a storage proof - the collateral is not at risk, it is merely set aside so that it can be put at risk later.  

**lostrevenue** | hastings  
The amount of revenue, including storage revenue and bandwidth revenue, that has been lost due to failed file contracts and failed storage proofs.  

**loststoragecollateral** | hastings  
The amount of collateral that was put up to protect data which has been lost due to failed file contracts and missed storage proofs.  

**potentialstoragerevenue** | hastings  
The amount of revenue that the host stands to earn if all storage proofs are submitted corectly and in time.  

**riskedstoragecollateral** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host has risked on file contracts. If the host starts missing storage proofs, the host can forfeit up to this many coins. In the event of a missed storage proof, locked storage collateral gets returned, but risked storage collateral does not get returned.  

**storagerevenue** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host has earned from storing data. This money has been locked down by successful storage proofs.  

**transactionfeeexpenses** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host has spent on transaction fees when submitting host announcements, file contract revisions, and storage proofs.  

**downloadbandwidthrevenue** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host has made from renters downloading their files. This money has been locked in by successsful storage proofs.  

**potentialdownloadbandwidthrevenue** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host stands to make from renters that downloaded their files. The host will only realize this revenue if the host successfully submits storage proofs for the related file contracts.  

**potentialuploadbandwidthrevenue** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host stands to make from renters that uploaded files. The host will only realize this revenue if the host successfully submits storage proofs for the related file contracts.  

**uploadbandwidthrevenue** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host has made from renters uploading their files. This money has been locked in by successful storage proofs.  

#### internalsettings  
The settings of the host. Most interactions between the user and the host occur by changing the internal settings.  

**acceptingcontracts** | boolean  
When set to true, the host will accept new file contracts if the terms are reasonable. When set to false, the host will not accept new file contracts at all.  

**maxdownloadbatchsize** | bytes  
The maximum size of a single download request from a renter. Each download request has multiple round trips of communication that exchange money. Larger batch sizes mean fewer round trips, but more financial risk for the host - the renter can get a free batch when downloading by refusing to provide a signature.  

**maxduration** | blocks  
The maximum duration of a file contract that the host will accept. The storage proof window must end before the current height + maxduration.  

**maxrevisebatchsize** | bytes  
The maximum size of a single batch of file contract revisions. The renter can perform DoS attacks on the host by uploading a batch of data then refusing to provide a signature to pay for the data. The host can reduce this exposure by limiting the batch size. Larger batch sizes allow for higher throughput as there is significant communication overhead associated with performing a batch upload.  

**netaddress** | string
The IP address or hostname (including port) that the host should be contacted at. If left blank, the host will automatically figure out its ip address and use that. If given, the host will use the address given.  

**windowsize** | blocks  
The storage proof window is the number of blocks that the host has to get a storage proof onto the blockchain. The window size is the minimum size of window that the host will accept in a file contract.  

**collateral** | hastings / byte / block

**collateralbudget** | hastings  
The total amount of money that the host will allocate to collateral across all file contracts.  

**maxcollateral** | hastings  
The maximum amount of collateral that the host will put into a
single file contract.  

**mincontractprice** | hastings  
The minimum price that the host will demand from a renter when forming a contract. Typically this price is to cover transaction fees on the file contract revision and storage proof, but can also be used if the host has a low amount of collateral. The price is a minimum because the host may automatically adjust the price upwards in times of high demand.  

**mindownloadbandwidthprice** | hastings / byte  
The minimum price that the host will demand from a renter when the renter is downloading data. If the host is saturated, the host may increase the price from the minimum.  

**minstorageprice** | hastings / byte / block  
The minimum price that the host will demand when storing data for extended periods of time. If the host is low on space, the price of storage may be set higher than the minimum.  

**minuploadbandwidthprice** | hastings / byte  
The minimum price that the host will demand from a renter when the renter is uploading data. If the host is saturated, the host may increase the price from the minimum.  

#### networkmetrics

**downloadcalls** | int 
The number of times that a renter has attempted to download something from the host.  

**errorcalls** | int

**unrecognizedcalls** | int
The number of times that a renter has attempted to use an unrecognized call. Larger numbers typically indicate buggy software.  

**connectabilitystatus** | string
connectabilitystatus is one of "checking", "connectable", or "not connectable", and indicates if the host can connect to itself on its configured NetAddress.  

**workingstatus** | string
workingstatus is one of "checking", "working", or "not working" and indicates if the host is being actively used by renters.

**capacity** | bytes
Maximum capacity of the storage folder in bytes. The host will not store more than this many bytes in the folder. This capacity is not checked against the drive's remaining capacity. Therefore, you must manually ensure the disk has sufficient capacity for the folder at all times. Otherwise you risk losing renter's data and failing storage proofs.  

**capacityremaining** | bytes   
Unused capacity of the storage folder in bytes.

## /host/storage/folders/add [POST]

adds a storage folder to the manager. The manager may not check that there is enough space available on-disk to support as much storage as requested

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**path** | string  
Local path on disk to the storage folder to add.  

**size** | bytes  
Initial capacity of the storage folder. This value isn't validated so it is possible to set the capacity of the storage folder greater than the capacity of the disk. Do not do this.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /host/storage/folders/remove [POST]

Remove a storage folder from the manager. All sotrage on the folder will be moved to other stoarge folders, meaning that no data will be lost. If the manager is unable to save data, an error will be returned and the operation will be stopped.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**path** | string  
Local path on disk to the storage folder to removed.  

#### OPTIONAL
**force** | boolean  
If `force` is true, the storage folder will be removed even if the data in the storage folder cannot be moved to other storage folders, typically because they don't have sufficient capacity. If `force` is true and the data cannot be moved, data will be lost.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /host/storage/folders/resize [POST]

Grows or shrinks a storage file in the manager. The manager may not check that there is enough space on-disk to support growing the storasge folder, but should gracefully handle running out of space unexpectedly. When shrinking a storage folder, any data in the folder that neeeds to be moved will be placed into other storage folders, meaning that no data will be lost. If the manager is unable to migrate the data, an error will be returned and the operation will be stopped.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**path** | string  
Local path on disk to the storage folder to resize.  

**newsize** | bytes  
Desired new size of the storage folder. This will be the new capacity of the storage folder.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /host/storage/sectors/delete/:*merkleroot* [POST]

Deletes a sector, meaning that the manager will be unable to upload that sector and be unable to provide a storage proof on that sector. This endpoint is for removing the data entirely, and will remove instances of the sector appearing at all heights. The primary purpose is to comply with legal requests to remove data.

### Path Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**merkleroot** | merkleroot
Merkleroot of the sector to delete.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

**maxdownloadbatchsize** | bytes  
Maximum number of bytes that the host will allow to be requested by a single download request.  

**maxduration** | blocks  
Maximum duration in blocks that a host will allow for a file contract. The host commits to keeping files for the full duration under the threat of facing a large penalty for losing or dropping data before the duration is complete. The storage proof window of an incoming file contract must end before the current height + maxduration.  

There is a block approximately every 10 minutes. e.g. 1 day = 144 blocks  

**maxrevisebatchsize** | bytes  
Maximum size in bytes of a single batch of file contract revisions. Larger batch sizes allow for higher throughput as there is significant communication overhead associated with performing a batch upload.  

**netaddress** | sting
Remote address of the host. It can be an IPv4, IPv6, or hostname, along with the port. IPv6 addresses are enclosed in square brackets.  

**remainingstorage** | bytes  
Unused storage capacity the host claims it has.  

**sectorsize** | bytes  
Smallest amount of data in bytes that can be uploaded or downloaded to or from the host.  

**totalstorage** | bytes  
Total amount of storage capacity the host claims it has.  

**unlockhash** | hash
Address at which the host can be paid when forming file contracts.  

**windowsize** | blocks  
A storage proof window is the number of blocks that the host has to get a storage proof onto the blockchain. The window size is the minimum size of window that the host will accept in a file contract.  

**collateral** | hastings / byte / block  
The maximum amount of money that the host will put up as collateral for storage that is contracted by the renter.  

**maxcollateral** | hastings  
The maximum amount of collateral that the host will put into a single file contract.  

**contractprice** | hastings  
The price that a renter has to pay to create a contract with the host. The payment is intended to cover transaction fees for the file contract revision and the storage proof that the host will be submitting to the blockchain.  

**downloadbandwidthprice** | hastings / byte  
The price that a renter has to pay when downloading data from the host.  

**storageprice** | hastings / byte / block  
The price that a renter has to pay to store files with the host.  

**uploadbandwidthprice** | hastings / byte  
The price that a renter has to pay when uploading data to the host.  

**revisionnumber** | int
The revision number indicates to the renter what iteration of settings the host is currently at. Settings are generally signed. If the renter has multiple conflicting copies of settings from the host, the renter can expect the one with the higher revision number to be more recent.  

**version** | string
The version of the host.  

**firstseen** | blocks  
Firstseen is the last block height at which this host was announced.  

**historicdowntime** | nanoseconds
Total amount of time the host has been offline.  

**historicuptime** | nanoseconds  
Total amount of time the host has been online.

**recentfailedinteractions** | int  
Number of recent failed interactions with the host.  

**recentsuccessfulinteractions** | int
Number of recent successful interactions with the host.  

**lasthistoricupdate** | blocks  
The last time that the interactions within scanhistory have been compressed into the historic ones.  

**ipnets**  
List of IP subnet masks used by the host. For IPv4 the /24 and for IPv6 the /54 subnet mask is used. A host can have either one IPv4 or one IPv6 subnet or one of each. E.g. these lists are valid: [ "IPv4" ], [ "IPv6" ] or [ "IPv4", "IPv6" ]. The following lists are invalid: [ "IPv4", "IPv4" ], [ "IPv4", "IPv6", "IPv6" ]. Hosts with an invalid list are ignored.  

**lastipnetchange** | date  
The last time the list of IP subnet masks was updated. When equal subnet masks are found for different hosts, the host that occupies the subnet mask for a longer time is preferred.  

**publickey**

## /hostdb/all [GET]

Lists all of the hosts known to the renter. Hosts are not guaranteed to be in any particular order, and the order may change in subsequent calls.

### JSON Response 
Repsonse is the same as [`/hostdb/active`](#hosts)

## /hostdb/hosts/:*pubkey* [GET]

fetches detailed information about a particular host, including metrics regarding the score of the host within the database. It should be noted that each renter uses different metrics for selecting hosts, and that a good score on in one hostdb does not mean that the host will be successful on the network overall.

### Path Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**pubkey**  
The public key of the host. Each public key identifies a single host.  

Example Pubkey: ed25519:1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef  

### JSON Response

  }
}
```
Response is the same as [`/hostdb/active`](#hosts) with the additional of the **scorebreakdown**

**scorebreakdown**  
A set of scores as determined by the renter. Generally, the host's final score is all of the values multiplied together. Modified renters may have additional criteria that they use to judge a host, or may ignore certin criteia. In general, these fields should only be used as a loose guide for the score of a host, as every renter sees the world differently and uses different metrics to evaluate hosts.  

**score** | big int
The overall score for the host. Scores are entriely relative, and are consistent only within the current hostdb. Between different machines, different configurations, and different versions the absolute scores for a given host can be off by many orders of magnitude. When displaying to a human, some form of normalization with respect to the other hosts (for example, divide all scores by the median score of the hosts) is recommended.  

**conversionrate** | float64 
conversionrate is the likelihood that the host will be selected by renters forming contracts.  

**ageadjustment** | float64 
The multiplier that gets applied to the host based on how long it has been a host. Older hosts typically have a lower penalty.  

**burnadjustment** | float64 
The multiplier that gets applied to the host based on how much proof-of-burn the host has performed. More burn causes a linear increase in score.  

**collateraladjustment** | float64 
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on how much collateral the host is offering. More collateral is typically better, though above a point it can be detrimental.  

**interactionadjustment** | float64 
The multipler that gets applied to a host based on previous interactions with the host. A high ratio of successful interactions will improve this hosts score, and a high ratio of failed interactions will hurt this hosts score. This adjustment helps account for hosts that are on unstable connections, don't keep their wallets unlocked, ran out of funds, etc.  

**pricesmultiplier** | float64 
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on the host's price. Lower prices are almost always better. Below a certain, very low price, there is no advantage.  

**storageremainingadjustment** | float64 
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on how much storage is remaining for the host. More storage remaining is better, to a point.  

**uptimeadjustment** | float64 
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on the uptime percentage of the host. The penalty increases extremely quickly as uptime drops below 90%.  

**versionadjustment** | float64 
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on the version of Sia that they are running. Versions get penalties if there are known bugs, scaling limitations, performance limitations, etc. Generally, the most recent version is always the one with the highest score.  

## /hostdb/filtermode [POST]

Lets you enable and disable a filter mode for the hostdb. Currenlty the two modes supported are `blacklist` mode and `whitelist` mode. In `blacklist` mode, any hosts you identify as being on the `blacklist` will not be used to form contracts. In `whitelist` mode, only the hosts identified as being on the `whitelist` will be used to form contracts. In both modes, hosts that you are blacklisted will be filtered from your hostdb. To enable either mode, set `filtermode` to the desired mode and submit a list of host pubkeys as the corresponding `blacklist` or `whitelist`. To disable either list, the `host` field can be left blank (e.g. empty slice) and the `filtermode` should be set to `disable`.  

**NOTE:** Enabling and disabling a filter mode can result in changes with your current contracts with can result in an increase in contract fee spending. For example, if `blacklist` mode is enabled, any hosts that you currently have contracts with that are also on the provide list of `hosts` will have their contracts replaced with non-blacklisted hosts. When `whitelist` mode is enabled, contracts will be replaced until there are only contracts with whitelisted hosts. Even disabling a filter mode can result in a change in contracts if there are better scoring hosts in your hostdb that were previously being filtered out.  

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**filtermode** | string  
Can be either whitelist, blacklist, or disable.  

**hosts** | array of string
Comma separated pubkeys.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

# Miner

The miner provides endpoints for getting headers for work and submitting solved headers to the network. The miner also provides endpoints for controlling a basic CPU mining implementation.

## /miner [GET]

returns the status of the miner.

### JSON Response 
> JSON Response Example
 
```go
{
  "blocksmined":      9001,   // int
  "cpuhashrate":      1337,   // hashes / second
  "cpumining":        false,  // boolean
  "staleblocksmined": 0,      // int
}
```
**blocksmined** | int
Number of mined blocks. This value is remembered after restarting.  

**cpuhashrate** | hashes / second
How fast the cpu is hashing, in hashes per second.  

**cpumining** | boolean
true if the cpu miner is active.  

**staleblocksmined** | int  
Number of mined blocks that are stale, indicating that they are not included in the current longest chain, likely because some other block at the same height had its chain extended first.  


## /miner/start [GET]

Starts a single threaded CPU miner. Does nothing if the CPU miner is already running.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /miner/stop [GET]

stops the cpu miner. Does nothing if the cpu miner is not running.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /miner/header [GET]

provides a block header that is ready to be grinded on for work.

### Byte Response
For efficiency the header for work is returned as a raw byte encoding of the header, rather than encoded to JSON.

Blocks are mined by repeatedly changing the nonce of the header, hashing the header's bytes, and comparing the resulting hash to the target. The block with that nonce is valid if the hash is less than the target. If none of the 2^64 possible nonces result in a header with a hash less than the target, call /miner/header [GET] again to get a new block header with a different merkle root. The above process can then be repeated for the new block header.  

The other fields can generally be ignored. The parent block ID field is the hash of the parent block's header. Modifying this field will result in an orphan block. The timestamp is the time at which the block was mined and is set by the Sia Daemon. Modifying this field can result in invalid block. The merkle root is the merkle root of a merkle tree consisting of the timestamp, the miner outputs (one leaf per payout), and the transactions (one leaf per transaction). Modifying this field will result in an invalid block.

Field | Byte range within response | Byte range within header
-------------- | -------------- | --------------
target | [0-32)
header | [32-112)
parent block ID | [32-64) | [0-32)
nonce | [64-72) | [32-40)
timestamp | [72-80) | [40-48)
merkle root | [80-112) | [48-80)

## /miner/header [POST]

submits a header that has passed the POW.

### Byte Response
For efficiency headers are submitted as raw byte encodings of the header in the body of the request, rather than as a query string parameter or path parameter. The request body should contain only the 80 bytes of the encoded header. The encoding is the same encoding used in `/miner/header [GET]` endpoint.

Blocks are mined by repeatedly changing the nonce of the header, hashing the header's bytes, and comparing the resulting hash to the target. The block with that nonce is valid if the hash is less than the target. If none of the 2^64 possible nonces result in a header with a hash less than the target, call /miner/header [GET] again to get a new block header with a different merkle root. The above process can then be repeated for the new block header.  

The other fields can generally be ignored. The parent block ID field is the hash of the parent block's header. Modifying this field will result in an orphan block. The timestamp is the time at which the block was mined and is set by the Sia Daemon. Modifying this field can result in invalid block. The merkle root is the merkle root of a merkle tree consisting of the timestamp, the miner outputs (one leaf per payout), and the transactions (one leaf per transaction). Modifying this field will result in an invalid block.

Field | Byte range within response | Byte range within header
-------------- | -------------- | --------------
target | [0-32)
header | [32-112)
parent block ID | [32-64) | [0-32)
nonce | [64-72) | [32-40)
timestamp | [72-80) | [40-48)
merkle root | [80-112) | [48-80)

**destination** | string
Local path that the file will be downloaded to.  

**destinationtype** | string
What type of destination was used. Can be "file", indicating a download to disk, can be "buffer", indicating a download to memory, and can be "http stream", indicating that the download was streamed through the http API.  

**length** | bytes  
Length of the download. If the download was a partial download, this will indicate the length of the partial download, and not the length of the full file.  

**offset** | bytes
Offset within the file of the download. For full file downloads, the offset will be '0'. For partial downloads, the offset may be anywhere within the file. offset+length will never exceed the full file size.  

**siapath** | string
Siapath given to the file when it was uploaded.  

**completed** | oolean  
Whether or not the download has completed. Will be false initially, and set to true immediately as the download has been fully written out to the file, to the http stream, or to the in-memory buffer. Completed will also be set to true if there is an error that causes the download to fail.  

**endtime** | date, RFC 3339 time  
Time at which the download completed. Will be zero if the download has not yet completed.  

**error** | string
Error encountered while downloading. If there was no error (yet), it will be the empty string.

**starttime** | date, RFC 3339 time  
Time at which the download was initiated.

**totaldatatransfered** | bytes
The total amount of data transfered when downloading the file. This will eventually include data transferred during contract + payment negotiation, as well as data from failed piece downloads.  

## /renter/downloads/clear [POST]

Clears the download history of the renter for a range of unix time stamps.  Both parameters are optional, if no parameters are provided, the entire download history will be cleared.  To clear a single download, provide the timestamp for the download as both parameters.  Providing only the before parameter will clear all downloads older than the timestamp. Conversely, providing only the after parameter will clear all downloads newer than the timestamp.

### Query String Parameters
#### OPTIONAL
**before** | unix timestamp  
unix timestamp found in the download history

**after** | unix timestamp   
unix timestamp found in the download history

### Response

    }
  ]
}
```
#### files
**siapath** | string
Path to the file in the renter on the network.  

**localpath** | string
Path to the local file on disk.  

**filesize** | bytes  
Size of the file in bytes.  

**available** | boolean  
true if the file is available for download. Files may be available before they are completely uploaded.  

**renewing** | boolean  
true if the file's contracts will be automatically renewed by the renter.  

**redundancy** | float64
Average redundancy of the file on the network. Redundancy is calculated by dividing the amount of data uploaded in the file's open contracts by the size of the file. Redundancy does not necessarily correspond to availability. Specifically, a redundancy >= 1 does not indicate the file is available as there could be a chunk of the file with 0 redundancy.  

**uploadedbytes** | bytes  
Total number of bytes successfully uploaded via current file contracts. This number includes padding and rendundancy, so a file with a size of 8192 bytes might be padded to 40 MiB and, with a redundancy of 5, encoded to 200 MiB for upload.  

**uploadprogress** | percent  
Percentage of the file uploaded, including redundancy. Uploading has completed when uploadprogress is 100. Files may be available for download before upload progress is 100.  

**expiration** | block height
Block height at which the file ceases availability.  

**ondisk** | boolean
indicates if the source file is found on disk

**recoverable** | boolean
indicates if the siafile is recoverable

### Query String Parameters
#### OPTIONAL
**trackingpath** | string
If provided, this parameter changes the tracking path of a file to the  specified path. Useful if moving the file to a different location on disk.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/delete/*siapath* [POST]

deletes a renter file entry. Does not delete any downloads or original files, only the entry in the renter.

### Path Parameters

### Path Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**siapath** | string
Path to the file in the renter on the network.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**destination** | string
Location on disk that the file will be downloaded to.  

#### OPTIONAL
**async** | boolean
If async is true, the http request will be non blocking. Can't be used with:  

**httpresp** | boolean
If httresp is true, the data will be written to the http response.  

**length** | bytes
Length of the requested data. Has to be <= filesize-offset.  

**offset** | bytes
Offset relative to the file start from where the download starts.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/downloadsync/*siapath* [GET]

downloads a file to the local filesystem. The call will return immediately.

### Path Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**siapath** | string
Path to the file in the renter on the network.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**destination** | string
Location on disk that the file will be downloaded to.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/rename/*siapath* [POST]

### Path Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**siapath** | string
Path to the file in the renter on the network.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**newsiapath** | string

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/stream/*siapath* [GET]

downloads a file using http streaming. This call blocks until the data is received. The streaming endpoint also uses caching internally to prevent siad from re-downloading the same chunk multiple times when only parts of a file are requested at once. This might lead to a substantial increase in ram usage and therefore it is not recommended to stream multiple files in parallel at the moment. This restriction will be removed together with the caching once partial downloads are supported in the future. If you want to stream multiple files you should increase the size of the Renter's `streamcachesize` to at least 2x the number of files you are steaming.

### Path Parameters

**siapath** | string
Path to the file in the renter on the network.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/upload/*siapath* [POST]

# Wallet

## /wallet [GET]

Returns basic information about the wallet, such as whether the wallet is locked or unlocked.

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example

```go
{
  "encrypted":  true,   // boolean
  "unlocked":   true,   // boolean
  "rescanning": false,  // boolean

  "confirmedsiacoinbalance":     "123456", // hastings, big int
  "unconfirmedoutgoingsiacoins": "0",      // hastings, big int
  "unconfirmedincomingsiacoins": "789",    // hastings, big int

  "siafundbalance":      "1",    // siafunds, big int
  "siacoinclaimbalance": "9001", // hastings, big int

  "dustthreshold": "1234", // hastings / byte, big int
}
```
**encrypted** | boolean  
Indicates whether the wallet has been encrypted or not. If the wallet has not been encrypted, then no data has been generated at all, and the first time the wallet is unlocked, the password given will be used as the password for encrypting all of the data. 'encrypted' will only be set to false if the wallet has never been unlocked before (the unlocked wallet is still encryped - but the encryption key is in memory).  

**unlocked** | boolean  
Indicates whether the wallet is currently locked or unlocked. Some calls become unavailable when the wallet is locked.  

**rescanning** | boolean  
Indicates whether the wallet is currently rescanning the blockchain. This will be true for the duration of calls to /unlock, /seeds, /init/seed, and /sweep/seed.  

**confirmedsiacoinbalance** | hastings, big int  
Number of siacoins, in hastings, available to the wallet as of the most recent block in the blockchain.  

**unconfirmedoutgoingsiacoins** | hastings, big int  
Number of siacoins, in hastings, that are leaving the wallet according to the set of unconfirmed transactions. Often this number appears inflated, because outputs are frequently larger than the number of coins being sent, and there is a refund. These coins are counted as outgoing, and the refund is counted as incoming. The difference in balance can be calculated using 'unconfirmedincomingsiacoins' - 'unconfirmedoutgoingsiacoins'  

**unconfirmedincomingsiacoins** | hastings, big int  
Number of siacoins, in hastings, are entering the wallet according to the set of unconfirmed transactions. This number is often inflated by outgoing siacoins, because outputs are frequently larger than the amount being sent. The refund will be included in the unconfirmed incoming siacoins balance.  

**siafundbalance** | big int  
Number of siafunds available to the wallet as of the most recent block in the blockchain.  

**siacoinclaimbalance** | hastings, big int  
Number of siacoins, in hastings, that can be claimed from the siafunds as of the most recent block. Because the claim balance increases every time a file contract is created, it is possible that the balance will increase before any claim transaction is confirmed.  

**dustthreshold** | hastings / byte, big int  
Number of siacoins, in hastings per byte, below which a transaction output cannot be used because the wallet considers it a dust output.  

## /wallet/033x [POST]

  "address": "1234567890abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789ab"
}
```
**address** | hash
Wallet address that can receive siacoins or siafunds. Addresses are 76 character long hex strings.  

## /wallet/addresses [GET]

Fetches the list of addresses from the wallet. If the wallet has not been created or unlocked, no addresses will be returned. After the wallet is unlocked, this call will continue to return its addresses even after the wallet is locked again.

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example
 
```go
{
  "addresses": [
    "1234567890abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789ab",

    "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"
  ]
}
```
**addresses**  
Array of wallet addresses owned by the wallet.  

## /wallet/backup [GET]

Creates a backup of the wallet settings file. Though this can easily be done manually, the settings file is often in an unknown or difficult to find location. The /wallet/backup call can spare users the trouble of needing to find their wallet file.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**destination**  
Path to the location on disk where the backup file will be saved.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /wallet/changepassword [POST]

Changes the wallet's encryption key.  

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**encryptionpassword** | string
encryptionpassword is the wallet's current encryption password.  

**newpassword** | string
newpassword is the new password for the wallet.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /wallet/init [POST]

Initializes the wallet. After the wallet has been initialized once, it does not need to be initialized again, and future calls to /wallet/init will return an error. The encryption password is provided by the api call. If the password is blank, then the password will be set to the same as the seed.

### Query String Parameters
#### OPTIONAL WALLET PARAMETERS
**encryptionpassword** | string
Password that will be used to encrypt the wallet. All subsequent calls should use this password. If left blank, the seed that gets returned will also be the encryption password.  

**dictionary** | string  
Name of the dictionary that should be used when encoding the seed. 'english' is the most common choice when picking a dictionary.  

**force** | boolean  
When set to true /wallet/init will Reset the wallet if one exists instead of returning an error. This allows API callers to reinitialize a new wallet.

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example
 
```go
{
  "primaryseed": "hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello"
}
```
**primaryseed**  
Wallet seed used to generate addresses that the wallet is able to spend.  

## /wallet/init/seed [POST]

Initializes the wallet using a preexisting seed. After the wallet has been initialized once, it does not need to be initialized again, and future calls to /wallet/init/seed will return an error. The encryption password is provided by the api call. If the password is blank, then the password will be set to the same as the seed. Note that loading a preexisting seed requires scanning the blockchain to determine how many keys have been generated from the seed. For this reason, /wallet/init/seed can only be called if the blockchain is synced.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED WALLET PARAMETERS
**seed** | string
Dictionary-encoded phrase that corresponds to the seed being used to initialize the wallet.  

#### OPTIONAL
[Optional Wallet Parameters](#optional-wallet-parameters)

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /wallet/seed [POST]

Gives the wallet a seed to track when looking for incoming transactions. The wallet will be able to spend outputs related to addresses created by the seed. The seed is added as an auxiliary seed, and does not replace the primary seed. Only the primary seed will be used for generating new addresses.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
[Required Wallet Parameters](#required-wallet-parameters)

#### OPTIONAL | string
[Optional Wallet Parameters](#optional-wallet-parameters)

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /wallet/seeds [GET]

Returns the list of seeds in use by the wallet. The primary seed is the only seed that gets used to generate new addresses. This call is unavailable when the wallet is locked.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**dictionary** | string 
Name of the dictionary that should be used when encoding the seed. 'english' is the most common choice when picking a dictionary.  

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example

```go
{
  "primaryseed":        "hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello",

    "foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo",
  ]
}
```
**primaryseed**  
Seed that is actively being used to generate new addresses for the wallet.  

**addressesremaining**  
Number of addresses that remain in the primary seed until exhaustion has been reached. Once exhaustion has been reached, new addresses will continue to be generated but they will be more difficult to recover in the event of a lost wallet file or encryption password.  

**allseeds**  
Array of all seeds that the wallet references when scanning the blockchain for outputs. The wallet is able to spend any output generated by any of the seeds, however only the primary seed is being used to generate new addresses.  

## /wallet/siacoins [POST]



Sends siacoins to an address or set of addresses. The outputs are arbitrarily selected from addresses in the wallet. If 'outputs' is supplied, 'amount' and 'destination' must be empty.  

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED

    "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"
  ]
}
```
**transactionids**  
Array of IDs of the transactions that were created when sending the coins. The last transaction contains the output headed to the 'destination'. Transaction IDs are 64 character long hex strings.  

## /wallet/siafunds [POST]

Sends siafunds to an address. The outputs are arbitrarily selected from addresses in the wallet. Any siacoins available in the siafunds being sent (as well as the siacoins available in any siafunds that end up in a refund address) will become available to the wallet as siacoins after 144 confirmations. To access all of the siacoins in the siacoin claim balance, send all of the siafunds to an address in your control (this will give you all the siacoins, while still letting you control the siafunds).

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**amount** | siafunds  
Number of siafunds being sent.  

**destination** | address  
Address that is receiving the funds.  

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example
 
```go
{
  "transactionids": [
    "1234567890abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
    "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
    "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"
  ]
}
```
**transactionids**  
Array of IDs of the transactions that were created when sending the coins. The last transaction contains the output headed to the 'destination'. Transaction IDs are 64 character long hex strings.  

## /wallet/siagkey [POST]

Loads a key into the wallet that was generated by siag. Most siafunds are currently in addresses created by siag.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**encryptionpassword**  
Key that is used to encrypt the siag key when it is imported to the wallet.  

**keyfiles**  
List of filepaths that point to the keyfiles that make up the siag key. There should be at least one keyfile per required signature. The filenames need to be commna separated (no spaces), which means filepaths that contain a comma are not allowed.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /wallet/sign [POST]

Signs a transaction. The wallet will attempt to sign each input specified. The transaction's TransactionSignatures should be complete except for the Signature field. If `tosign` is provided, the wallet will attempt to fill in signatures for each TransactionSignature specified. If `tosign` is not provided, the wallet will add signatures for every TransactionSignature that it has keys for.

      }
    ]
  }
}
```
**transaction**  
Raw transaction. The rest of the fields in the resposne are determined from this raw transaction. It is left undocumented here as the processed transaction (the rest of the fields in this object) are usually what is desired.  

See types.Transaction in https://gitlab.com/NebulousLabs/Sia/blob/master/types/transactions.go  

**transactionid**  
ID of the transaction from which the wallet transaction was derived.  

**confirmationheight**  
Block height at which the transaction was confirmed. If the transaction is unconfirmed the height will be the max value of an unsigned 64-bit integer.  

**confirmationtimestamp**  
Time, in unix time, at which a transaction was confirmed. If the transaction is unconfirmed the timestamp will be the max value of an unsigned 64-bit integer.  

**inputs**  
Array of processed inputs detailing the inputs to the transaction.  

**parentid**  
The id of the output being spent.  

**fundtype**  
Type of fund represented by the input. Possible values are 'siacoin input' and 'siafund input'.  

**walletaddress** | Boolean  
true if the address is owned by the wallet.  

**relatedaddress**  
Address that is affected. For inputs (outgoing money), the related address is usually not important because the wallet arbitrarily selects which addresses will fund a transaction.  

**value** | hastings or siafunds, depending on fundtype, big int  
Amount of funds that have been moved in the input.  

**outputs**  
Array of processed outputs detailing the outputs of the transaction. Outputs related to file contracts are excluded.  

**id**  
The id of the output that was created.  

**fundtype**  
Type of fund is represented by the output. Possible values are 'siacoin output', 'siafund output', 'claim output', and 'miner payout'. Siacoin outputs and claim outputs both relate to siacoins.  

Siafund outputs relate to siafunds.  

Miner payouts point to siacoins that have been spent on a miner payout. Because the destination of the miner payout is determined by the block and not the transaction, the data 'maturityheight', 'walletaddress', and 'relatedaddress' areleft blank.  

**maturityheight**  
Block height the output becomes available to be spent. Siacoin outputs and siafund outputs mature immediately - their maturity height will always be the confirmation height of the transaction. Claim outputs cannot be spent until they have had 144 confirmations, thus the maturity height of a claim output will always be 144 larger than the confirmation height of the transaction.  

**walletaddress** | boolean  
true if the address is owned by the wallet.  

**relatedaddress**  
Address that is affected. For outputs (incoming money), the related address field can be used to determine who has sent money to the wallet.  

**value** | hastings or siafunds, depending on fundtype, big int  
Amount of funds that have been moved in the output.  

## /wallet/transactions [GET]

Returns a list of transactions related to the wallet in chronological order.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**startheight** | block height  
// Height of the block where transaction history should begin.

**endheight** | block height  
Height of of the block where the transaction history should end. If 'endheight' is greater than the current height, or if it is '-1', all transactions up to and including the most recent block will be provided.
