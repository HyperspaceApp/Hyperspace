Host DB API
===========

This document contains detailed descriptions of the hostdb's API routes. For an
overview of the hostdb's API routes, see [API.md#host-db](/doc/API.md#host-db).
For an overview of all API routes, see [API.md](/doc/API.md)

There may be functional API calls which are not documented. These are not
guaranteed to be supported beyond the current release, and should not be used
in production.

Overview
--------

The hostdb maintains a database of all hosts known to the network. The database
identifies hosts by their public key and keeps track of metrics such as price.

#### /hostdb [GET] [(example)](#hostdb-get)

shows some general information about the state of the hostdb.

###### JSON Response

Either the following JSON struct or an error response. See [#standard-responses](#standard-responses).

```javascript
{
    "initialscancomplete": false // indicates if all known hosts have been scanned at least once.
}
```

#### /hostdb/active [GET] [(example)](#active-hosts)

lists all of the active hosts known to the renter, sorted by preference.

###### Query String Parameters
```
// Number of hosts to return. The actual number of hosts returned may be less
// if there are insufficient active hosts. Optional, the default is all active
// hosts.
numhosts
```

#### /hostdb/hosts/___:pubkey___ [GET] [(example)](#hosts)

fetches detailed information about a particular host, including metrics
regarding the score of the host within the database. It should be noted that
each renter uses different metrics for selecting hosts, and that a good score on
in one hostdb does not mean that the host will be successful on the network
overall.

###### Path Parameters
```
// The public key of the host. Each public key identifies a single host.

#### /hostdb/filtermode [POST] 

lets you enable and disable a filter mode for the hostdb. Currenlty the two
modes supported are `blacklist` mode and `whitelist` mode. In `blacklist` mode,
any hosts you identify as being on the `blacklist` will not be used to form
contracts. In `whitelist` mode, only the hosts identified as being on the
`whitelist` will be used to form contracts. In both modes, hosts that you are
blacklisted will be filtered from your hostdb. To enable either mode, set
`filtermode` to the desired mode and submit a list of host pubkeys as the
corresponding `blacklist` or `whitelist`. To disable either list, the `host`
field can be left blank (ie empty slice) and the `filtermode` should be set to
`disable`.

**NOTE:** Enabling and disabling a filter mode can result in changes with your
current contracts with can result in an increase in contract fee spending. For
example, if `blacklist` mode is enabled, any hosts that you currently have
contracts with that are also on the provide list of `hosts` will have their
contracts replaced with non-blacklisted hosts. When `whitelist` mode is enabled,
contracts will be replaced until there are only contracts with whitelisted
hosts. Even disabling a filter mode can result in a change in contracts if there
are better scoring hosts in your hostdb that were previously being filtered out.

###### Request Body
